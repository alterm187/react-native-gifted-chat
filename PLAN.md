# Plan: Create a Scaffold Chat UI Project

The goal is to create a new, self-contained directory named `agentUI` that includes the essential components from this project to build a visually appealing chat interface.

1.  **Create the Project Structure:**
    *   A new top-level directory named `agentUI` will be created.
    *   Inside `agentUI`, a `src` directory will be created to hold the copied components.
    *   A subdirectory structure within `src` will be created to mirror the original project's organization for components like `GiftedChat`, `Bubble`, `Message`, etc.
    *   An `assets` directory will be created inside `agentUI/src` to hold any necessary static assets like images or fonts.

2.  **Copy Core UI Components and Dependencies:**
    *   I will identify and copy the essential React Native components required for a complete chat UI from the current project's `src` directory. This includes:
        *   `GiftedChat/index.tsx`: The main, all-in-one chat component.
        *   Starting from `GiftedChat/index.tsx`, I will trace all of its local dependencies (other components, hooks, utils, etc.) and copy them over to ensure that no dependencies are missed.
    *   I will also copy the associated `styles.ts`, `types.ts`, and other utility files that these components depend on.
    *   Any static assets required by the components will be copied to the `agentUI/src/assets` directory.

3.  **Create an Example `App.tsx`:**
    *   A new `App.tsx` file will be created inside the `agentUI` directory.
    *   This file will serve as the main entry point for your new UI component. It will import the `GiftedChat` component and render it with some sample messages, providing a clear example of how to use it.

4.  **Generate a `package.json`:**
    *   A `package.json` file will be created for the `agentUI` project.
    *   I will analyze the `package.json` of the original project and the import statements in the copied files to identify all necessary third-party libraries.
    *   The `package.json` will define the project and its dependencies, including `react`, `react-native`, and any other required libraries.

5.  **Add Configuration Files:**
    *   I will create or copy over minimal versions of essential configuration files, such as `tsconfig.json` for a TypeScript project and `babel.config.js` for Babel configuration, to ensure the project can be built and run correctly.

6.  **Add an `index.js` Entry Point:**
    *   An `index.js` file will be created to register the `App` component, which is the standard entry point for a React Native application.

7.  **Add a `README.md`:**
    *   A `README.md` file will be created in the `agentUI` directory with the following sections:
        *   A brief description of the project.
        *   A list of dependencies.
        *   Instructions on how to install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
        *   Instructions on how to run the example app (`npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`).

After executing this plan, you will have an `agentUI` directory that is a self-contained, ready-to-use scaffold. You can then copy this directory to a new repository and start building your chat interface for your ADK agent.
